<b>Brain Tumor Detection with EfficientNet and Convolutional Neural Networks.</b>

<b>Overview</b>
This project focuses on the detection of brain tumors using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Magnetic Resonance (MR) images as a dataset. To overcome the challenge of a limited number of samples, we employed Transfer Learning (TL) with a pre-trained EfficientNet model. This approach eliminated the need for manual scaling during training, resulting in improved performance compared to existing CNN architectures.

<b>Framework</b>
In our proposed framework, we utilized EfficientNet-B2, EfficientNet-B3, and EfficientNet-B4 models, showcasing consistent enhancements in accuracy. The images underwent resizing, cropping, and augmentation to further boost the training accuracy. Comparative analysis with ResNet-50 revealed superior results with EfficientNet models, emphasizing the importance of scaling width, perseverance, and depth concurrently for efficient model optimization.

<b>Results</b>
EfficientNet models (B2, B3, B4) outperformed ResNet-50 with increased accuracy in brain tumor detection.
The reduction in computational requirements with EfficientNet suggests potential applications in mobile devices.
EfficientNet-B7 demonstrated even better performance by capturing richer and more complex features.
